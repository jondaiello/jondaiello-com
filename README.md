This is the repository for my personal site. I'm redesigning and rebuilding my site from the ground up. 

"Why?", you ask? Well, here are a list of goals for my new site:

1. Improve performance
2. Improve accessibility
3. Level challenge myself, extend my skillset and learn new stuff
4. Leave jQuery behind...
5. Continuously improve it through design and development

These are the purpose of the redesign.

## Project Targets
- Write the universal/baseline styles to the page in a `<style>` element if it is beneficial.
- Write performance driven vanilla Javascript.
- Keep the front page under 200kb on cellular networks (some detection required)
- 1 second perceived load time
- Utilize SVGs & CSS shapes
- Make use of system fonts
- Use Gulp via npm.
- It works (well) without Javascript.
