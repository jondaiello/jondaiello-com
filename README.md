This is the repository for my personal site. I'm redesigning and rebuilding my site from the ground up. 

"Why?", you ask? Well, here are a list of goals for my new site:

1. Improve performance
2. Improve accessibility
3. Level challenge myself, extend my skillset and learn new stuff
4. Leave jQuery behind...
5. Continuously improve it through design and development

These are the purpose of the redesign.
