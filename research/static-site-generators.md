# To Static or Dynamic?
I've been using typical dynamic content management systems ever ([ExpressionEngine](https://ellislab.com/expressionengine), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), [Habari](http://habariproject.org/en/)) for my sites over the past 10 years. In the name of performance & security, I'm wondering if swithing to a static site generator would be a good idea. The problem I'm facing is that there are so many options that it's hard for me to decide. Also, static site generation is a new area so I know very little about it.

This file will serve a log to myself as well as to the rest of the community. At some point, I'll make a blog post about my decision making process and the end result.

## Questions

1. How in the WORLD do I choose one [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/)?
2. What's the best method to build and deploy the site?
3. I'd like to be able to post and deploy from any device (even a phone), is this possible?
4. What are some of the best hosting options?
5. More questions to come...
