        <p>First off, I have to make a confession: As a white male in my 30s in the web industry, I never really cared about diversity. In fact, it was quite the opposite. I often felt like I had to ‘fight’ to get recognized or find new opportunities. I had to fight against intentional decision making against my demographic. I am not unique, therefore I am overlooked. At times this caused me great frustration and often anger at the initiative.</p>
