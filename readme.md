This is the repository for my personal site. I'm redesigning and rebuilding my site from the ground up. 

"Why?", you ask? Well, here are a list of goals for my new site:

1. Improve performance 🏎
2. Improve accessibility 👏🏻
3. Make design more awesomesauce 🧙🏻‍
4. Level challenge myself, extend my skillset and learn new stuff🏋🏻‍
5. Leave jQuery behind...🛑
6. Continuously improve it through design and development 🛣

These are the purpose of the redesign.

## Project Targets
- Keep the front page under 200kb on cellular networks (some detection required)
- 1 second or less perceived load time
- Utilize SVGs & CSS shapes
- Node and JS
- It works (well) without Javascript in browser.

## Future Features
- Include snippets & demos section
- Utilize [prizm.js](http://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting
- Include portfolio of design
